# Wedding Website
A beautiful, feature rich, device friendly wedding website.
Used this to manage all the guest list for my wedding and as a digital invite.
See [jorgef21.github.io](http://perlayjorge.com/) for a demo.

# Highlights
1. Slick and fully __responsive__ design.
2. __RSVP feature__ which directly uploads data to a mongodb(using forest admin to add/delete/update)
3. __Receive email alerts__ when someone RSVPs.
4. __Add to Calendar__ feature which supports four different calendars.
5. __Book Uber__ button lets guests book a cab to the venue with just a single tap.


# Documentation (pending...)
